 **MangosZero - Vanilla World of Warcraft game server**
===

**Mangos** is an open source project written in [C++][7]. It's fast, runs on multiple
platforms and stores game data in [MySQL][40] or [MariaDB][41]. It also has 
optional support for SOAP.

If you liked the original incarnation of [World of Warcraft][2] and still want to play it,
this is the branch for you. We provide an authentication server where you can manage your users, 
and a world server which serves game content just like the original did back then.

It aims to be 100% compatible with the 3 final versions of Vanilla [World of Warcraft][2], 
namely [patch 1.12.1][4], [patch 1.12.2][5] & [patch 1.12.3][6].
<br>**IT DOES NOT SUPPORT 1.13.x** and beyond which is the newly released Classic Experience (NuClassic).

On top of that each update is automatically built by [Travis CI][16] (Linux/MAC) and [AppVeyor][17] (Windows)
as you can see by the images in the heading above! We do love green builds, and working things.

Requirements
------------
The server supports a wide range of operating systems, and various compiler platforms.
In order to do that, we use various free cross-platform libraries and use [CMake][19] to provide
a cross-platform build system which adapts to your chosen operating system and compiler.

Operating systems
-----------------
Currently we support running the server on the following operating systems:

* **Windows**, 32 bit and 64 bit. [Windows][20] Server 2008 (or newer) or Windows 7 (or newer) is recommended.
* **Linux**, 32 bit and 64 bit. [Debian 7][21] and [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS][22] are
  recommended. Other distributions with similar package versions will work, too.
* **BSD**, 32 bit and 64 bit. [FreeBSD][23], [NetBSD][24], [OpenBSD][25] are recommended.

Of course, newer versions should work, too. In the case of Windows, matching
server versions will work, too.

Compilers
---------
Building the server is currently possible with these compilers:

* **Microsoft Visual Studio 32 bit and 64 bit.** All editions of [Visual Studio][31]
from 2015 upwards are officially supported.

* **Clang**, 32 bit and 64 bit. The [Clang compiler][33] can be used on any
  supported operating system.

Dependencies
------------
The server stands on the shoulders of several well-known Open Source libraries plus
a few awesome, but less known libraries to prevent us from inventing the wheel again.

**Please note that Linux and Mac OS X users should install packages using
their systems package management instead of source packages.**

* **MySQL** / **MariaDB**: to store content, and user data, we rely on
  [MySQL][40]/[MariaDB][41] to handle data.
* **ACE**: the [ADAPTIVE Communication Environment][43] aka. *ACE* provides us
  with a solid cross-platform framework for abstracting operating system
  specific details.
* **Recast**: in order to create navigation data from the client's map files,
  we use [Recast][44] to do the dirty work. It provides functions for
  rendering, pathing, etc.
* **G3D**: the [G3D][45] engine provides the basic framework for handling 3D
  data, and is used to handle basic map data.
* **Stormlib**: [Stormlib][46] provides an abstraction layer for reading from the
  client's data files.
* **Zlib**: [Zlib][53] ([Zlib for Windows][51]) provides compression algorithms
  used in both MPQ archive handling and the client/server protocol.
* **Bzip2**: [Bzip2][54] ([Bzip2 for Windows][52]) provides compression
  algorithms used in MPQ archives.
* **OpenSSL**: [OpenSSL][48] ([OpenSSL for Windows][55]) provides encryption
  algorithms used when authenticating clients.

**ACE**, **Recast**, **G3D**, **Stormlib**, **Zlib** and **Bzip2** are included in the standard distribution as
we rely on specific versions.

Optional dependencies
---------------------

* **Doxygen**: if you want to export HTML or PDF formatted documentation for the
  Mangos API, you should install [Doxygen][49].
